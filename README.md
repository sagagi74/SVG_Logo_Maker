SVG_Logo_Maker

This Application demonstrates to develop a Node.js command-line application that captures user input to create a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application should prompt the user to choose a color and shape, input text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

1 Start the Application: Run the command-line application.

2 Enter Text: When asked, type in up to three characters for your logo.

3 Choose Text Color: Enter a color for the text. You can use a color name (like "red" or "blue") or a hexadecimal color code (like "#FF5733").

4 Select a Shape: You'll see a list of shapes to choose fromâ€”circle, triangle, and square. Pick one that you like.

5 Choose Shape Color: Enter a color for the shape, just like you did for the text. Use a color name or a hexadecimal code.

6 Generate the Logo: After you've entered all the details, the application will create an SVG file called logo.svg.

7 Check the Output: Look for the message "Generated logo.svg" in the command line to confirm it worked.

8 View Your Logo: Open the logo.svg file in a web browser. You'll see a 300x200 pixel image that matches the text, colors, and shape you selected.
